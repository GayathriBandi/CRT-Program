# ðŸ“˜ Computer Networks 
## ðŸ”¶ 1. Basics of Computer Networks
- **Computer Network:** A system of interconnected computers/devices that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and applications.
- **Key Objectives:**
  - Efficient communication (emails, messages)
  - Resource sharing (files, printers, internet)
  - Cost reduction and centralized data management
  - Scalability, fault tolerance, and backup support
- **Types of Networks:**
  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small geographical area; high speed (100Mbps to 1Gbps); e.g., office/home.
  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city; e.g., cable TV networks.
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large regions/countries (e.g., Internet).
  - **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Limited to personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth, USB tethering).

## ðŸ”¶ 2. Network Topologies
- **Topology:** The physical or logical layout of network devices.
- **Types:**
  - **Star Topology:** Central hub; easy to manage; failure of hub disrupts entire network.
  - **Bus Topology:** Single cable backbone; cost-effective; collision-prone.
  - **Ring Topology:** Nodes form a loop; data flows in one direction; token-passing.
  - **Mesh Topology:** Every device connects to every other; redundant; expensive.
  - **Hybrid Topology:** Mix of above; commonly used in real-world large networks.

## ðŸ”¶ 3. OSI Model â€“ 7 Layers Explained
| Layer | Description | Protocols/Devices |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 7. **Application** | Interface for users/apps to access network | HTTP, FTP, SMTP |
| 6. **Presentation** | Translates, encrypts, compresses data | JPEG, SSL, ASCII |
| 5. **Session** | Manages session setup and teardown | NetBIOS, RPC |
| 4. **Transport** | End-to-end connection, flow & error control | TCP, UDP |
| 3. **Network** | Routing, addressing, logical paths | IP, ICMP, Routers |
| 2. **Data Link** | Frame creation, MAC, switches | Ethernet, ARP |
| 1. **Physical** | Transmission of raw bits | Cables, Hubs, NIC |

---

## ðŸ”¶ 4. TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
- A simplified, practical model for networking.
- **Layers:**
  1. **Application Layer** â€“ Web, Email, DNS
  2. **Transport Layer** â€“ TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)
  3. **Internet Layer** â€“ IP, ICMP
  4. **Network Access Layer** â€“ Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC

---

## ðŸ”¶ 5. IP Addressing
- **IPv4:** 32-bit; written in dotted decimal (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
- **IPv6:** 128-bit; hex format; solves IPv4 exhaustion (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
- **Address Classes:**
  - **A:** 0â€“127 (large networks)
  - **B:** 128â€“191 (medium networks)
  - **C:** 192â€“223 (small networks)
  - **D:** 224â€“239 (multicast)
  - **E:** 240â€“255 (research/reserved)

---

## ðŸ”¶ 6. Subnetting (With Example)
- Breaks a large network into smaller networks.
- **Example:**
  - IP: 192.168.1.0/24 â†’ Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  - Subnet into 4 â†’ /26 mask â†’ each block = 64 addresses
- **Benefits:**
  - Better security
  - Efficient IP usage
  - Improved performance

---

## ðŸ”¶ 7. Protocols in Networking
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
  - Connection-oriented
  - Guarantees delivery and order
  - Used in email, file transfers, web pages
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
  - Connectionless
  - Faster but no reliability (used in live streaming, DNS)
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Web data transfer (Hypertext Transfer Protocol + Secure)
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Transfers files between client-server
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Converts domain to IP (e.g., google.com â†’ 142.250.x.x)
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP:** Mail sending and retrieval
- **SNMP:** Network device monitoring
- **ICMP:** Used by ping/traceroute for diagnostics

## ðŸ”¶ 8. Networking Devices
| Device  | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Router** | Connects multiple networks; routes data |
| **Switch** | Connects devices in LAN; intelligent forwarding |
| **Hub** | Basic broadcaster; sends data to all |
| **Bridge** | Connects LANs; filters traffic |
| **Modem** | Converts analog to digital (ISP use) |
| **Gateway** | Translates between protocols |

---

## ðŸ”¶ 9. Transmission Modes
- **Simplex:** One-way only (e.g., keyboard to computer)
- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way, one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie)
- **Full-Duplex:** Both ways at once (e.g., phone call)

---

## ðŸ”¶ 10. Transmission Media
- **Wired Media:**
  - Twisted Pair: Cheap, common in LANs
