Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
  
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

  #include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int thirdMax(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    long first = LONG_MIN, second = LONG_MIN, third = LONG_MIN;

    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        long num = nums[i];
        if (num == first || num == second || num == third)
            continue;
        if (num > first) {
            third = second;
            second = first;
            first = num;
        } else if (num > second) {
            third = second;
            second = num;
        } else if (num > third) {
            third = num;
        }
    }

    return third == LONG_MIN ? first : third;
}
